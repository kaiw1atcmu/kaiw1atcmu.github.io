_Figure 1: My Perspective on Scientific Research._

## How Is Research Formally Defined?
In some universities, *research* might probably be define in this way:
> Research is defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so
> as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings. This could include synthesis and analysis of previous
> research to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.

> This definition of research is consistent with a broad notion of research and experimental development (R&D) as
> comprising of creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including
> knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.

> This definition of research encompasses pure and strategic basic research, applied research and experimental
> development. Applied research is original investigation undertaken to acquire new knowledge but directed towards a
> specific, practical aim or objective (including a client-driven purpose).

## What Is My Perspective On Scientific Research?
As a veteran software developer and seasoned algorithm engineer, I constantly feel unfulfilled with the passive
acquisition of ready-made knowledge alone, and I am in the conviction that quality research should be conducted and
consolidated with a principled, mathematical methodology.
