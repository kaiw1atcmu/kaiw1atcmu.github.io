## About Me
Hi there! I'm Kaiser Wang, an awesome backend programmer and self-motivated researcher. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a recent CS-related graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. I will keep on authoring
posts concerning algorithms, maths/statistics, machine learning/deep learning, as well as leisure stuff. I will be very
appreciative if you can contact me via kaiw1atcmu[at]sina.com for any issues or suggestions concerning this weblog.

## Motivation For This Site
This documentation-styled Jekyll Theme blog was forked from
[Tom Johnson's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll) as the outgrowth of over 40 active
contributors' joint effort. Accoriding to the theme's owner, "[t]his theme has undergone several major iterations, and
now itâ€™s fairly stable and full of all the features that [he] need[s]." Although the theme is primarily intended for
hosting documentations (e.g. one for an open-source Python library), still I found it excellent if adapted or customized
for the purpose of personal weblogs.

Again, thanks for reading, and please keep an eye on what's going on here!

## Hierarchy Of This Site
### Where To Find Posts
I will temporarily store sketched posts under *News* in the navigation bar. After being edited and refined, it will be
removed from *News* and be permanently placed in the side bar under the folder for its respective category. Further
updates to the posts are still possible, if necessary.

### Where To Find Repositories
I will provide a link to my GitHub page under *GitHub* in the navigation bar, where all my repositories are displayed.

### Where To Find Publications
I will post copies of my publications (including pre-prints on *arxiv*, technical reports, conference/journal papers,
etc.) under *Products* in the navigation bar.

## Logistics
### Versioning Convention
I will give this website a date-fashioned versioning scheme to notify readers of when it lastly underwent major changes.
That is, I will version it 20.12.26.00 if the last major change I pushed to GitHub was at 2020-12-26 00:xx:xx -0800. I
prefer the timezone -0800, i.e. Pacific Standard Time (PST).

### Comment Areas
I have to withhold the activation of comment areas, since subscribing to this service costs $5 per month.
