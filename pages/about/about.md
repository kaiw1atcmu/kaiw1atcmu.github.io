Hi there! I'm Kaiser Wang, an awesome backend programmer and self-motivated researcher. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a recent CS-related graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. I will keep on authoring
posts concerning algorithms, maths/statistics, machine learning/deep learning, as well as leisure stuff. I will be very
appreciative if you can contact me via kaiw1atcmu[at]sina.com for any issues or suggestions concerning this tech blog.
