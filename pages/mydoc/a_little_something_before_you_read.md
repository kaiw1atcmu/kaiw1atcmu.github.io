## About Me
Hi there! I'm Kaiser Wang, an awesome backend programmer and self-motivated researcher. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a recent CS-related graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. I will keep on authoring
posts concerning algorithms, maths/statistics, machine learning/deep learning, as well as leisure stuff. I will be very
appreciative if you can contact me via kaiw1atcmu[at]sina.com for any issues or suggestions concerning this weblog.

## Motivation For Choosing This Theme
This documentation-styled Jekyll Theme blog was forked from
[Tom Johnson's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll) as the outgrowth of over 40 active
contributors' joint effort. According to the theme's owner, "[t]his theme has undergone several major iterations, and
now itâ€™s fairly stable and full of all the features that [he] need[s]." Although the theme is primarily intended for
hosting documentations (e.g. one for an open-source Python library), still I found it excellent if adapted or customized
for the purpose of personal weblogs.

Again, thanks for reading, and please keep an eye on what's going on here!

## Hierarchy Of This Site
### Where To Find Public Posts
I will place links to public posts in the display-mode menu on homepage, appearing under corresponding categories they
belong to. The public posts placed here are fairly stable, while still subject to minor updates, such as adding most
recent SOTA algorithms. Each update will be accompanied by a short note in front of its content.

### Where To Find Github Repositories
I will provide a link to my GitHub page under <font face="Lora">GitHub</font> in the navigation bar, where all my
repositories/projects are displayed.

### Where To Find News
I will temporarily store all kinds of news that appeals to me under <font face="Lora">News</font> tab in the navigation
bar. The pages/posts containing stale pieces of news will periodically be replaced by that containing newer pieces.

### Where To Find Academic Publications
I will post copies of my publications (including pre-prints on <font face="Lora">arxiv</font>, technical reports,
conference/journal papers, etc.) under <font face="Lora">Publications</font> in the navigation bar, if any.

### Where To Find Jekyll Help
I will place several links to Jekyll resources under <font face="Lora">Jekyll Help</font> in the navigation bar. It will
act as a grammar cheatsheet and benefit bloggers who build their websites on top of Jekyll and GitHub, like me.

## Logistics
### Versioning Convention
I will give this website a date-fashioned versioning scheme to notify readers of when it lastly underwent major changes.
That is, I will version it 20.12.26.00 if the last major change I pushed to GitHub was at 2020-12-26 00:xx:xx -0800. I
prefer Timezone -0800, i.e. Pacific Standard Time (PST).

### Comment Areas
I have to temporarily withhold the activation of comment areas powered by [commento.io](https://commento.io), since
subscribing to this service costs $5 per month.
