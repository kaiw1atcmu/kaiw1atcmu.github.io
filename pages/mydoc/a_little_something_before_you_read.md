        Panorama at Dawntime, City of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon University and The University of Pittsburgh are
        located far from the downtown area, over the upper right horizon of the landscape. You simply can not see them.

## About The Author
My name is Kaiser Wang, an awesome backend programmer and self-motivated researcher. I'm a recent CS-related graduate
student from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. On this website, I will keep on authoring posts
concerning algorithms, maths/statistics, machine learning/deep learning, as well as personal stuff. Again, thanks for
reading, and please keep an eye on what's going on here! Although I haven't activated the comment functionality provided
by [commento.io](https://commento.io), I will be very appreciative if you can contact me via kaiw1atcmu[at]sina.com for
any issues or suggestions concerning this tech blog.

## Motivation For Choosing This Theme
This documentation-styled Jekyll Theme blog was forked from
[Tom Johnson's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll) as the outgrowth of over 40 active
contributors' joint effort. According to the theme's owner, "<font face="Lora">[t]his theme has undergone several major
iterations, and now itâ€™s fairly stable and full of all the features that [he] need[s].</font>" Although the theme is
primarily intended for hosting documentation pages (e.g. one for an open-source Python library), still I found it
excellent when adapted or customized for the purpose of a personal tech blog, if redundant functionality modules are
removed.

## Hierarchy Of This Site
### Where To Find Public Pages
I will place links to categories of pages in the display-mode menu on this website's homepage. The public pages that
appear under their corresponding categories are fairly stable, while still being subject to minor updates, such as
adding the most recent SOTA algorithms. Each update will be accompanied by a short note in front of its content.

### Where To Find Author Information
I will create a dedicated page to providing my updated personal information under <font face="Lora">About</font> in the
navigation bar. Feedback for any issues or suggestions concerning this tech blog can be redirected to my email. 

### Where To Find Github Pages
I will provide a link to my GitHub front page under <font face="Lora">GitHub</font> in the navigation bar, where all my
repositories/projects are displayed.

### Where To Find Academic Publications
I will post downloadable copies of my publications (including pre-prints on <font face="Lora">arxiv</font>, technical
reports, conference/journal papers, etc.) under <font face="Lora">Publications</font> in the navigation bar, if any.

## Logistics
### Timing Convention
I prefer Timezone -0800, i.e. Pacific Standard Time (PST), to notify readers of when a page/post lastly underwent
changes, in the front matter of each Markdown/HTML source file. For example,
```markdown
date: 2020-12-26 19:39:02 -0800
last_updated: December 26, 2020
```
However, the last modified dates at the footnote are automatically generated and are not of my choosing.

### Comment Areas
I have to temporarily withhold the activation of comment areas powered by [commento.io](https://commento.io), since
subscribing to this service costs $5 per month.
