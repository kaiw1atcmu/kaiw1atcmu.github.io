        Panorama at Dawntime, City of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon University and The University of Pittsburgh are
        located far from the downtown area, over the upper right horizon of the landscape. You simply can not see them.

## About Me
Hi there! I'm Kaiser Wang, an awesome backend programmer and self-motivated researcher. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a recent CS-related graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. I will keep on authoring
posts concerning algorithms, maths/statistics, machine learning/deep learning, as well as leisure stuff. I will be very
appreciative if you can contact me via kaiw1atcmu[at]sina.com for any issues or suggestions concerning this weblog.

## Motivation For This Site
This documentation-styled Jekyll Theme blog was forked from
[Tom Johnson's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll) as the outgrowth of over 40 active
contributors' joint effort. According to the theme's owner, "[t]his theme has undergone several major iterations, and
now itâ€™s fairly stable and full of all the features that [he] need[s]." Although the theme is primarily intended for
hosting documentations (e.g. one for an open-source Python library), still I found it excellent if adapted or customized
for the purpose of personal weblogs.

Again, thanks for reading, and please keep an eye on what's going on here!

## Hierarchy Of This Site
### Where To Find Public Posts
I will place public posts in the side bar, where they appear under corresponding categories they belong to. The public
posts placed here are fairly stable, while still subject to minor updates, such as adding most recent SOTA algorithms.

### Where To Find Sketch Posts
I will temporarily store sketched posts under *Sketch Posts* in the navigation bar. After being edited and refined, they
will be removed from *Sketch Posts* and permanently placed in the side bar under the dropdown folder corresponding to
the categories they belong to. Further updates to the posts are still possible, if necessary.

### Where To Find Github Repositories
I will provide a link to my GitHub page under *GitHub Repos* in the navigation bar, where all my repositories/projects
are displayed.

### Where To Find Academic Publications
I will post copies of my publications (including pre-prints on *arxiv*, technical reports, conference/journal papers,
etc.) under *Publications* in the navigation bar, if any.

## Logistics
### Versioning Convention
I will give this website a date-fashioned versioning scheme to notify readers of when it lastly underwent major changes.
That is, I will version it 20.12.26.00 if the last major change I pushed to GitHub was at 2020-12-26 00:xx:xx -0800. I
prefer the timezone -0800, i.e. Pacific Standard Time (PST).

### Comment Areas
I have to temporarily withhold the activation of comment areas, since subscribing to this service costs $5 per month.
