Today we are discussing a very interesting algorithmic problem called the friendly arrays.

## Problem Formulation
Informally, we define the $k$-th friendly array to be one integer array of length $2k$, in which each integer lies in
the range $[1,k]$ and appears exactly twice, in an manner that each pair of $i$'s are spaced by $i$ integers,
$i\in[1,k]$. Let us enumerate the first few friendly arrays, for example:

| the $n$-th ordinal | the $n$-th friendly arrays |
| :----: | :----: |
| the 1-st | (none) |
| the 2-nd | (none) |
| the 3-rd | (3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2), (2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3) |
| the 4-th | (2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4), (4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2) |
| the 5-th | (none) |
| the 6-th | (none) |
| the 7-th | (4, 6, 1, 7, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 7, 2, 5), and 51 more... |
| the 8-th | (6, 2, 8, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6, 3, 5, 4, 8, 3, 1, 7, 1), and 299 more... |

_Table 1: The Friendly Arrays For The First Few Ordinals_
    
Then what is the systematic procedure to generate (preferably in an exhaustive manner) such $k$-th friendly arrays? In
the very beginning, I was tempted to crack this problem by following the tricks applied to the
[*Josephus Problem*](#refenences). However, due to subtle differences, all efforts were in vain. Vicariously, it
suddenly dawned on me that the friendly arrays might be approached from a pure programming perspective with stacks, and
this opinion indeed worked out.

## Stack Version One
Without considerations for memory efficiency, this straight-forward approach using a stack consumes the most memory
space. Supposing for the $n$-th ordinal, the number of the $n$-th friendly arrays in total is given by $f(n)$. more to
come ...

```python
# Friendly Arrays Stack Version One

n = 8   # specify n for n-th friendly arrays
stack = []
status = {'filled': [0] * 2 * n, 'cur_val': n + 1}  # 'filled' is (partly) filled array, 'cur_val' is last value filled.
stack.append(status)
cnt = 0

while stack:
    status = stack[-1]
    array = status['filled']
    cur_val = status['cur_val'] - 1
    stack = stack[:-1]
    if cur_val == 0:    # already have filled 1, and you are done.
        cnt += 1
        print('The {}-th friendly array is {}'.format(cnt, status['filled']))
        continue
    for pos in range(2 * n - cur_val - 1):
        if array[pos] == 0 and array[pos + cur_val + 1] == 0:
            arr = array[:]  # clone by slicing
            arr[pos] = cur_val
            arr[pos + cur_val + 1] = cur_val
            stack.append({'filled': arr, 'cur_val': cur_val})
print('There are in total {} friendly arrays corresponding to the {}-th ordinal.'.format(cnt, n))
```

The complete friendly arrays are:

## Stack Version Two
With considerations for memory efficiency, this slightly improved approach (still using a stack) consumes much less
memory space. At any time, the stack at most unfolds one "status" for each level down through the hierarchy, essentially
trading time complexity for space complexity. Supposing for the $n$-th ordinal, the number of the $n$-th friendly arrays
in total is given by $f(n)$. more to come ...

```python
# Friendly Arrays Stack Version Two

n = 8   # specify n for n-th friendly arrays
stack = []
status = {'filled': [0] * 2 * n, 'cur_val': n}  # 'filled' is (partly) filled array, 'cur_val' is last value filled.
status['filled'][0] = n
status['filled'][n + 1] = n
stack.append(status)
cnt = 0

def next_step(stack):
    status = stack[-1]
    array = status['filled']
    cur_val = status['cur_val'] - 1
    for i in range(2 * n - cur_val - 1):
        if array[i] == 0 and array[i + cur_val + 1] == 0:
            arr = array[:]
            arr[i] = cur_val
            arr[i + cur_val + 1] = cur_val
            return stack + [{'filled': arr, 'cur_val': cur_val}]
    while stack:
        status = stack[-1]
        array = status['filled']
        cur_val = status['cur_val']
        pos = array.index(cur_val)
        array[pos] = 0
        array[pos + cur_val + 1] = 0
        for i in range(pos + 1, 2 * n - cur_val - 1):
            if array[i] == 0 and array[i + cur_val + 1] == 0:
                array[i] = cur_val  # modify array itself in place, no need to clone.
                array[i + cur_val + 1] = cur_val
                return stack
        stack = stack[:-1]
    return stack

while stack:
    status = stack[-1]
    array = status['filled']
    cur_val = status['cur_val'] - 1
    if cur_val == 0:    # already have filled 1, and you are done.
        cnt += 1
