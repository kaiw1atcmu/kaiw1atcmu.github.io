Welcome to my personal blog!

## Full-Featured Website For Free
Finally I got around to setting up my personal blog. Hosted by *GitHub* at essentially no cost, this personal website is
a light-weight one forked from [Tom Johnson's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll). A lot
easier than you thought it was going to be, isn't it? To be frank, I switched to GitHub powered by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) primarily because it's free of charge, and most of all, provides a light-weighted
personal blog solution to folks with minimal front-end programming experiences. However, you might have to browse
[Shopify documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) before becoming an expert on Jekyll's *Liquid* syntax.

Now I am authoring posts primarily using *Markdown*, an HTML-compatible format that delivers succinct syntax and stays
as powerful as other options. See [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) for details. In addition, there are a lot of
excellent [Jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes) written in it.

Besides, you have access to the JavaScript display engine, [*MathJax*](https://www.mathjax.org), that supports
high-resolution mathematical formulas in web browsers, and enables bloggers to write beautiful latex-styled content in
their posts. However, you have to include it in the header part of the template html file. Typically, it is placed under
folder *_posts*, and is named *default.html* or so.

{% include note.html content="Please be aware that the *MathJax* mechanism supports Latex-fashioned maths formulas. So
far as I know, this support does not extend to Latex elements other than maths, such as tabular." %}

## What To Expect From This Website
Like the famous German proverb goes, "*Aller Anfang ist schwer.*" However, I will keep on updating, and please keep an
eye and see what happens in the sequel. I bet it'll become one of your most upvoted personal blogs! Stay tuned!
