summary: "Today we are discussing a little bit of grammar on the elegant use of articles (i.e., the indefinite articles
a/an and the definite article the). In my view, excessive use of articles generally distracts readers from the major
train of thought, with a cluttered and fragmented writing style. In my view, we should care about readers' feelings by
moderating our use of articles when writing in English."

Today we are discussing a little bit of grammar on the elegant use of articles (i.e., the indefinite articles **a**/
**an** and the definite article **the**). In my view, excessive use of articles generally distracts readers from the
major train of thought, with a cluttered and fragmented writing style. In my view, we should care about readers'
feelings by moderating our use of articles when writing in English.

## General Rules
- We do not use articles before uncountable and abstract nouns used in a general sense.
> Honey is sweet.
- We do not use articles before plural countable nouns used in a general sense.
> Children usually rush about.

## Specific Rules
- We do not use articles before the names of countries, people, continents, cities, rivers and lakes.
> India is a democratic country.
- We do not use articles before the names of meals.
> Mother is cooking lunch.
- We do not use articles before the names of languages.
> His dad is still in hospital.
- We do not use articles before school, college, university, church, bed, hospital, prison, etc.
> His dad is still in hospital.

## Exception to Rules
- We use the when we are talking about a particular meal, etc.
> I met her at the church. (Here the reference is to the building and not to the activity that is going on there.)
- We use a when there is an adjective before breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.
> I had a late dinner yesterday.
