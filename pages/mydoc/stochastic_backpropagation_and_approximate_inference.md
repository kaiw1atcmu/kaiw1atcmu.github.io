The variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are frequently accredited to Diederik P. Kingma and Max Welling in their
[pioneer research paper](#references). However, a concurrent research paper by Google DeepMind proposed an identical
algorithm but named it otherwise. In fact, both papers cross referenced each other, in full recognition of their
counterpart's contribution. Today, let's discuss this somewhat less mentioned paper. (It was less mentioned maybe
because it used an awkward name.)
