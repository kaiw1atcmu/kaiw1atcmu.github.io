The dropout technique was proposed by Hinton et al. (2012) as a form of regularization for fully connected neural
network layers.<!--more--> More recently, the DropConnect technique, a generalization of dropout for regularizing large
fully-connected layers within neural networks, was proposed by LeCun et al. (2013). In this post, we are trying to give
ourselves an elementary guide through the dropout technique.
