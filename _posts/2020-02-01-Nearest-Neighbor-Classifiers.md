Nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers come from a broader background of statistical learning theory, the nonparametric
statistics.

## Error rate of KNN classifiers
An interesting property of the NN (that is, 1NN) classifier is that, in the limit $N\to\infty$, the error rate is never
more than twice the error rate of an optimal classifier, i.e. the Bayes error rate. more to come...
